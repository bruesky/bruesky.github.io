<!--JavaScript Inheritance-->
<!--The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create
new classes on the basis of already existing classes. It provides flexibility
to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.-->

<!--The JavaScript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class.
It facilitates child class to acquire all the properties and behavior of its parent class.-->

<!--Points to remember-->
<!--It maintains an IS-A relationship.-->
<!--The extends keyword is used in class expressions or class declarations.-->
<!--Using extends keyword, we can acquire all the properties and behavior of
the inbuilt object as well as custom classes.-->
<!--We can also use a prototype-based approach to achieve inheritance.-->
